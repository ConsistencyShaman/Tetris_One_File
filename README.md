# What's this?

A tetris game that I develop, this was my first JavaScript project, its currently deployed using github pages: ``` https://consistencyshaman.github.io/Tetris_One_File/ ```

## What I consider

My knowledge was very basic so I build the all game in one .js file, I used classes to define game logic and piece logic, array to store piece sizes.

I build this in a way that you only need to load the browser once to start playing it, after can be played without the need of refreshing the browser any time!

At the time I didn't consider memory management but I think stuff gets cleaned, at least doesnt crash any browser
